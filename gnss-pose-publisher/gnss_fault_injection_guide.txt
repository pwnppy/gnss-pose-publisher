1. Buid and Run
source install/setup.bash
ros2 run gnss_fault_injection gnss_fault_injection
*
*
*
2. Usage examples
If you want to start noise injection to gnss pose, write commandline:
ros2 topic pub /gnss_fault_injection/command std_msgs/msg/String "data: 'start'"

If you want to stop noise injection to gnss pose, write commandline:
ros2 topic pub /gnss_fault_injection/command std_msgs/msg/String "data: 'stop'"

Ctrl+C do not matter. Start or Stop command only works by activating through two commandlines.

3. Test
The gnss pose with or without noise according to commandline is published via '/sensing/gnss/pose_with_fault_injection' topic.

Can check the topic with the command below:
